Project Objective

In this project, I  looked at the cost of an undergraduate education for the average student throughout the United States by state. My objective was to find the average amount of money a student would have to pay for an undergraduate education as well as to find the cheapest state for a student to go to college. I also wanted to find out if college is viable to the average person in the United States.

Motivations

I was interested in the college experience and why it was so expensive to have the college experience for the average high school student. I also wanted to learn more about the access students had to different colleges in the United States, and the different financial struggles people had to go through for college across the states.
