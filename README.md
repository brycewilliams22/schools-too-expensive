Project Objective

In this project, I  looked at the cost of an undergraduate education for the average student throughout the United States by state. My objective was to find the average amount of money a student would have to pay for an undergraduate education as well as to find the cheapest state for a student to go to college. I also wanted to find out if college is viable to the average person in the United States.

Motivations

I was interested in the college experience and why it was so expensive to have the college experience for the average high school student. I also wanted to learn more about the access students had to different colleges in the United States, and the different financial struggles people had to go through for college across the states. 

Data Source

The data used in this project comes from the following:

Library Glossary

Numpy: Numpy is the fundamental package for computing in Python. It is a library that includes a multidimensional array object that includes an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays 

Pandas: Pandas is an open source Python program that is used dor machine learning tasks and data analysis. It is built on top of numpy, which was explained above.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a library used in python and many different kinds of 2D visulations and plots of arrays using the data.

Seaborn: Seaborn is a library used in python to make visualizations and to plot graphs using matplotlib.

Challenges

Finding the data was a big challenge in this project. It was difficult finding a dataset that could be used to answer the questions and the objectives that were set.

Another challenge was working by myself, it would have been easier to have a group so that I would be able to bounce ideas off and combine our skillsets to bring a better project to the table.

Deciding what story to tell was another challenge I faced. Having missed so much class time, it was difficult putting it all together.

I was limited by my python skillset, havind ideas and not being able to produce it based on my skillset.

Lessons Learned

Learning by trial and error is the smartest thing to do in python.

Trying out different datasets can be very useful.
