Project Objective

In this project, I  looked at the cost of an undergraduate education for the average student throughout the United States by state. My objective was to find the average amount of money a student would have to pay for an undergraduate education as well as to find the cheapest state for a student to go to college. I also wanted to find out if college is viable to the average person in the United States.
